      <p><h3>Recommendations to the Grants and Contributions Modernization Project (GCMP) on Development of a Future Communications Strategy (Government of Canada)</h3></p>

      <p>This is the result of a survey I developed and whose results I analyzed using coding schemes and Excel pivot tables to produce 22 recommendations to GCMP senior management. This is one of my main deliverables from my co-op placement in 2017.</p>

      <p><h3>Digital Music at the Prince George Public Library</h3></p>

      <p>Here is a report I wrote to the management staff at PGPL, outlining the benefits and drawbacks of three music streaming platforms for libraries: Freegal, Hoopla, and Naxos. I ultimately make a purchase recommendation given the budget constraints of the library during the 2016-2017 years.</p>

      <p><h3>The Visualization of Data</h3></p>

      <p>This is a project I did for a Research Methods &amp; Statistics class in early 2017. I talk about three different platforms for analyzing and visualizing data and their distinct capabilities. I close with some coming trends in 2017 we are expected to see with regards to data visualization and data science.</p>

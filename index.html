        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Bonjour hi!</p>
        <p>I’m Camille, welcome to my website which I use to publish my CV and other relevant information to hiring me.</p>

        <p>More about me: My background is in Mathematics, and along the way I dabbled in Statistics and Computer Science. Committed to lifelong learning, I came to a Master of Library &amp; Information Science program. As I am nearing completion of this program, I’m interested in the areas of data analysis and web development; in fact, I built this website myself from scratch. Both are areas where I can seek new challenges, solve problems, and continue learning. The affinities I have for logic-based reasoning, analysis, and programming are guiding my future direction, but my experience the field of LIS has fostered a passion for connecting people to information, and I think I can do this whether I’m building a user-friendly website, or extracting patterns from large data sets to inform business decisions, better public policy, or more. I am also an intermediate level French speaker; I practice daily with the goal of fluency and the ability to use this language in a professional environment.</p> 

        <p>Check out my CV page for all the details on my past experience.</p>
